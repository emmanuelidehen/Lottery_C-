 Write a program that simulates a lottery. The program should have an array of five
 integers named winningDigits, with a randomly generated number in the range of 0
 through 9 for each element in the array . The program should ask the user to enter five
 digits and should store them in a second integer array named player . The program must
 compare the corresponding elements in the two arrays and count how many digits match.
 For example, the following shows the winningDigits array and the Pl ayer array with
 sample numbers stored in each. There are two matching digits, elements 2 and 4.
 
 Once the user has entered a set of numbers, the program should display the winning
 digits and the player's digits and tell how many digits matched.
 
 
 
 Psuedo code:
 First Initiliaze all position to default
 Generate Random Numbers //Random generator!
 Ask user for choices of number and take those numbers and store in the player indexes!
 validate those inputs
 Print the Winning digits
 Print the players Digit
 compare the wining digits indexes and players digit indexes if any num match!
 print matching indexes!
 ask user if they'll like to continue!
